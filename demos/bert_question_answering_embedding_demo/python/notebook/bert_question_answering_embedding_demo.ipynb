    "# BERT Question Answering Embedding Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a Question Answering demo application that uses a SQuAD-tuned BERT model from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/) to calculate embedding vectors to find the right context for questions. See `bert_embedding_demo.py` in the same folder as this notebook for the source code to load the model and perform inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference from the [bert_question_answering_demo](../../../bert_question_answering_demo/README.md) is that this demo demonstrates how the inference can be accelerated via pre-computing the embeddings for the contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is loaded to OpenVINO Inference Engine. Data is fetched from the user-provided url to populate the list of \"contexts\" with the text. Prior to the actual inference to answer user's questions, the embedding vectors are pre-calculated (via inference) for each context from the list. This is done using the first (\"emdbeddings-only\") BERT model. After that, when user type the question and the \"embeddings\" network is used to calculate an embedding vector for the specified question. Using the L2 distance between the embedding vector of the question and the embedding vectors for the contexts the best (closest) contexts are selected as candidates to further seek for the final answer to the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is usually much shorter than the contexts, so calculating the embedding for that is really fast. Also calculating the L2 distance between a context and question is almost free, compared to the actual inference. Together, during question answering, this substantially saves on the actual inference, which is needed ONLY for the question (while contexts are pre-calculated), compared to the conventional approach that has to concatenate each context with the question and do an inference on this large input (per context).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second (conventional SQuAD-tuned) Bert model is used to further search for the exact answer in the best contexts found in the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Settings and Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the `input_url` to change the context of the model."
